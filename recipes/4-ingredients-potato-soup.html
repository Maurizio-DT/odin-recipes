    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound bacon</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) bag potatoes O’Brien with onions and peppers</li>
        <li>30 ounces chicken broth</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. 
            Drain bacon slices on paper towels; chop roughly when cool enough to handle.
        </li>
        <li>Working in batches, pour potatoes into the same skillet, and cook until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. 
            Remove potatoes to a slow cooker. Stir in chicken broth. 
            Dollop cheese spread on top; scatter bacon on top. 
            Cover slow cooker and cook on High until potatoes are very tender, 3 to 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
            If desired, ladle some of the soup, no more than halfway full, into a high powered blender. 
            Cover and hold lid down with a potholder; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend, about 45 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour soup back into slow cooker. Stir to combine; serve immediately.
        </li>
